# Bell Curve Simulator

The **Bell Curve Simulator** is a Python desktop application that allows users to simulate normal (Gaussian) distributions for a given number of students and draws per student. It visualizes the distribution, calculates statistical metrics, and allows exporting both raw data and plots.

---

## Features

- Simulate random draws from a normal distribution (`mean=50`, `std_dev=15`) for multiple students.
- Display results in real-time with a scrollable text output.
- Compute **Mean** and **Standard Deviation** for each simulation.
- Visualize the data as a histogram (bell curve) using Matplotlib.
- Export simulation data to CSV files.
- Save the generated histogram plots as PNG, JPG, or PDF.
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.
- Supports incremental, animated display of each draw with a progress bar.
- Input validation to ensure proper numeric entries and limits.
